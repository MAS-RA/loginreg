# Pull Request: Security and Usability Improvements

## Overview

Hello everyone! I'm Ali Saeed, and I've been working on enhancing the security and usability of the "loginreg" repository. These changes aim to improve authentication mechanisms, refine error handling, and provide a better overall user experience.

## Changes Made

### Login Script (login.php)

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
   - Implemented `filter_input` for email input validation.
   - Ensured required fields are marked in the HTML form.

2. **Prepared Statement Usage:**
   - Utilized prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

3. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Improved error handling during prepared statement execution.
   - Provided more meaningful error messages for debugging.

4. **Secure Session Handling:**
   - Implemented `session_regenerate_id` for a more secure session closure.
   - Mitigates potential session fixation attacks.

5. **Consistent Variable Naming:**
   - Maintained a consistent variable naming convention for improved readability.

6. **Improved HTML Structure:**
   - Ensured a well-formed HTML structure.
   - Added appropriate labels for form inputs, enhancing accessibility.

### Logout Script (logout.php)

1. **Enhanced Security:**
   - Validated and sanitized session data.
   - Used `session_regenerate_id(true)` for secure session closure.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Implemented a `try-catch` block to catch exceptions during the logout process.
   - Ensures graceful handling of unexpected issues and provides clear error messages.

3. **Redirect to Login Page:**
   - Redirected to the login page (`login.php`) after a successful logout.
   - Ensures a smooth transition for the user.

## Testing

I've rigorously tested these changes in a local development environment to ensure a secure authentication process and error-free execution. No regressions or adverse effects have been identified during testing.

## Feedback Requested

I kindly request your review and feedback on these enhancements. If approved, these changes will significantly fortify the security and user experience within the "loginreg" repository.

Thank you for your collaboration!
